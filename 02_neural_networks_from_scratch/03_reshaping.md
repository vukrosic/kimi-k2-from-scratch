# Reshaping Arrays in NumPy

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Understand different methods for reshaping NumPy arrays
- Use reshape, transpose, and other reshaping operations effectively
- Apply reshaping to solve real-world problems in machine learning
- Implement data preprocessing pipelines using reshaping
- Debug common reshaping errors and understand memory layout

## üìö Prerequisites

- Basic NumPy knowledge (arrays, shapes, basic operations)
- Understanding of matrix operations and broadcasting
- Familiarity with array dimensions and indexing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is Reshaping?

Reshaping is the process of changing the dimensions of an array without changing its data. It's like rearranging the same elements into different shapes - like taking a 1D line of numbers and arranging them into a 2D grid or 3D cube.

### Why is Reshaping Important?

- **Data preprocessing**: Convert data between different formats
- **Neural networks**: Reshape inputs for different layer types
- **Image processing**: Convert between different image representations
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimize data layout for operations
- **API compatibility**: Match expected input shapes

## üìñ Core Concepts

### 1. Basic Reshaping with `reshape()`

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print(f"Original shape: {arr_1d.shape}")

# Reshape to 2D
arr_2d = arr_1d.reshape(2, 3)
print(f"Reshaped to 2D: {arr_2d.shape}")
print(arr_2d)
# Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Reshape to 3D
arr_3d = arr_1d.reshape(2, 1, 3)
print(f"Reshaped to 3D: {arr_3d.shape}")
print(arr_3d)
# Output: [[[1, 2, 3]], [[4, 5, 6]]]
```

### 2. Using -1 for Automatic Dimension Calculation

```python
# Let NumPy calculate one dimension
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

# Reshape to 2 rows, let NumPy calculate columns
arr_2d = arr.reshape(2, -1)
print(f"Shape: {arr_2d.shape}")  # (2, 4)
print(arr_2d)

# Reshape to 4 columns, let NumPy calculate rows
arr_2d = arr.reshape(-1, 4)
print(f"Shape: {arr_2d.shape}")  # (2, 4)
print(arr_2d)

# Flatten to 1D
arr_flat = arr.reshape(-1)
print(f"Flattened shape: {arr_flat.shape}")  # (8,)
```

### 3. Transpose Operations

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])
print("Original:")
print(arr)
print(f"Shape: {arr.shape}")

# Transpose using .T
arr_transposed = arr.T
print("Transposed:")
print(arr_transposed)
print(f"Shape: {arr_transposed.shape}")

# Transpose using transpose()
arr_transposed2 = np.transpose(arr)
print("Transposed (method 2):")
print(arr_transposed2)
```

### 4. Multi-dimensional Transpose

```python
# Create a 3D array
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]],
                   [[7, 8, 9],
                    [10, 11, 12]]])
print(f"Original shape: {arr_3d.shape}")  # (2, 2, 3)

# Transpose different dimensions
arr_transposed = np.transpose(arr_3d, (1, 0, 2))
print(f"Transposed shape: {arr_transposed.shape}")  # (2, 2, 3)

# Transpose all dimensions
arr_transposed_all = np.transpose(arr_3d, (2, 1, 0))
print(f"All transposed shape: {arr_transposed_all.shape}")  # (3, 2, 2)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on Examples

### Example 1: Image Data Reshaping

```python
def preprocess_image(image, target_size):
    """
    Reshape image for neural network input
    
    Args:
        image: Image array (height, width, channels)
        target_size: Target size (height, width)
    
    Returns:
        processed_image: Reshaped image
    """
    # Flatten image
    flattened = image.reshape(-1)
    
    # Reshape to target size (assuming same number of channels)
    channels = image.shape[2]
    processed = flattened.reshape(target_size[0], target_size[1], channels)
    
    return processed

# Example usage
image = np.random.randn(32, 32, 3)  # 32x32 RGB image
target_size = (28, 28)

processed_image = preprocess_image(image, target_size)

def prepare_batch(data, batch_size):
    """
    Prepare data for batch processing
    
    Args:
        data: Input data (samples, features)
        batch_size: Number of samples per batch
    
    Returns:

    """
    num_samples = data.shape[0]
    batches = []
    
    for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
        batch = data[i:i+batch_size]
        batches.append(batch)
    
    return batches

# Example usage
data = np.random.randn(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features
batch_size = 32

batches = prepare_batch(data, batch_size)
print(f"Number of batches: {len(batches)}")
print(f"First batch shape: {batches[0].shape}")

```

    """
    Prepare data for CNN input
    
    Args:
        images: Image data (samples, height, width, channels)
        labels: Labels (samples,)
    
    Returns:
        X: Reshaped images for CNN
        y: One-hot encoded labels
    """
    # Reshape images for CNN (add batch dimension if needed)
    X = images.reshape(-1, images.shape[1], images.shape[2], images.shape[3])
    
    # One-hot encode labels
    num_classes = len(np.unique(labels))
    y = np.eye(num_classes)[labels]
    
    return X, y

# Example usage
images = np.random.randn(1000, 28, 28, 1)  # 1000 grayscale images
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)    # 10 classes

X, y = prepare_cnn_data(images, labels)
print(f"Images shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Labels shape: {y.shape}")
```

### Example 4: Sequence Data for RNNs

    """
    Prepare sequence data for RNN input
    
    Args:
        data: Time series data (time_steps, features)

    Returns:
        sequences: Reshaped sequences (samples, sequence_length, features)

```

## üéØ Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Reshaping
```python
# Practice these reshaping operations
arr = np.arange(24)  # [0, 1, 2, ..., 23]

# 1. Reshape to (4, 6)
# 2. Reshape to (6, 4)
# 3. Reshape to (2, 3, 4)
# 4. Reshape to (3, 2, 4)
# 5. Flatten back to 1D
```

### Exercise 2: Image Processing
```python
# Reshape image data for different purposes
image = np.random.randn(64, 64, 3)  # 64x64 RGB image

# 1. Flatten the image to 1D
# 2. Reshape to (3, 64, 64) - channels first
# 3. Reshape to (1, 64, 64, 3) - add batch dimension
# 4. Reshape to (3, 4096) - each channel as a row
```

### Exercise 3: Neural Network Data Preparation
```python
# Prepare data for different neural network types
data = np.random.randn(1000, 784)  # 1000 samples, 784 features (28x28 flattened)

# 1. Reshape for CNN: (1000, 28, 28, 1)
# 2. Reshape for RNN: (1000, 28, 28) - treat as sequences
# 3. Reshape for Transformer: (1000, 28, 28) - treat as tokens
# 4. Keep for Dense layer: (1000, 784)
```

## üîç Common Mistakes and Debugging

### Mistake 1: Incompatible Reshape Dimensions
```python
# This will cause an error
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Error: cannot reshape array of size 6 into shape (2, 4)
# arr_2d = arr.reshape(2, 4)  # This will fail
```

**Solution**: Check total elements match
```python
print(f"Original size: {arr.size}")
print(f"Target size: {2 * 4}")

# Correct reshaping
arr_2d = arr.reshape(2, 3)  # 2 * 3 = 6 ‚úì
print("Correct reshape:", arr_2d)
```

### Mistake 2: Confusing Reshape with Transpose
```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])

# Reshape changes the layout
reshaped = arr.reshape(3, 2)
print("Reshaped:")
print(reshaped)

# Transpose changes the orientation
transposed = arr.T
print("Transposed:")
print(transposed)
```

### Mistake 3: Memory Layout Issues
```python
# Reshape creates a view (no copy)
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped = arr.reshape(6)

# Modifying the view affects the original
reshaped[0] = 999
print("Original after modifying view:")
print(arr)  # Original is changed!

# To avoid this, use copy()
arr_copy = arr.copy()
reshaped_copy = arr_copy.reshape(6)
reshaped_copy[0] = 888
print("Original after modifying copy:")
print(arr)  # Original is unchanged
```

## üìä Key Takeaways

1. **Reshaping changes dimensions** without changing data
2. **Total elements must match** - can't reshape 6 elements into 8
3. **Reshape creates views** - be careful with memory layout
4. **Transpose changes orientation** - different from reshape
5. **Essential for neural networks** - different layers need different shapes
6. **Use -1 for automatic calculation** - let NumPy figure out one dimension
