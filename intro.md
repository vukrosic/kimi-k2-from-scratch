3. How to execute your code with `python file_name.py`

If you are struggling with any of these - you will be learning the most important skill - how to use YouTube and AI chatbots like ChatGPT to learn.
- Search for videos and ask AI to help you with any of the issues you have.




### Assessment Questions
**Test your Python knowledge with these 3 questions:**

1. **Variables and Data Types:** Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns both the sum and average. What data types are you working with?

2. **Control Flow:** Create a Python script that prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, for numbers 1-20.

3. **Functions and Classes:** Define a simple Python class called `Calculator` with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Include error handling for division by zero.

**If you can answer all 3 questions confidently, you're ready to proceed with the LLM tutorial!**
