This course contains every for you to go from knowing nothing to beingn able to get a junior job at OpenAI or Google.

You will not only code and train your own LM that you can talk to, but we will also write and publish a real research paper on how to create a small language model that anyone can train for free - I will publish this paper on arxiv - a real research paper that LLM that you can use to get a job at OpenAI or other frontier company, or start your own company or contribute to open source and publish more papers.

You will learn absolutely latest advancements from AI that only top researchers in the field konw, that are held behind closed dors at OpenAI and Google.

- **Beginners**: People with or without basic Python knowledge
- **Intermediate**: Developers familiar with PyTorch wanting to build LLMs
- **Advanced**: Top AI Researchers from OpenAI & Google wanting to keep up with the latest research

## **Part 1: Python Foundations**

explain how to learn python
what they should konw
give some prompts and chatbots or google colab notebooks to test them
link to resources and chats for each

#### Check timestamps / chapters below the video to skip what you know, but you can watch it even if you know it.

Learn basics of python. I recommend this video: [Python Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). No need to watch it all, but k

### Python Learning Resources
- **YouTube Tutorials (you only need to learn basics):**
You can also search for other python beginner tutorials, they will teach the same thing, you just need to learn it from one.

Examples:
  - [Python for Beginners - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) - 4.5 hours comprehensive Python tutorial
  - [Python Crash Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJmcL1N2KQs) - 1 hour quick start guide

From these tutorials you need to know:
1. How to install python on your computer
2. How to use IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write your code
3. How to execute your code with `python file_name.py`
4. Create variable, list, function, if statement, for loop.
5. Create class - this is included in the first course but you can learn more, search for object oriented programming in python.
Example: [Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/iLRZi0Gu8Go)

If you are struggling with any of these - you will be learning the most important skill - learn how to learn - how to use YouTube and AI chatbots like ChatGPT to learn.
- Search for videos and ask AI to help you with any of the issues you have - once you learn how to learn with internet and AI, you will be able to learn anything.

Example prompt for AI to teach you python 1 on 1:

"I need to master Python classes and object-oriented programming. Teach me casses step by step."

You can also run all of this on [Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A) without needing to setup local coding environment (on your computer).

## **No need to be able to code all of this from memory, but be able to read and understand what each does.**

There is a folder 01_python_beginner_lessons that will be supplementary materials for studnets to learn, it contains supplementary markdown lessons.

## **Part 2: not sure**
so here wo could have pytorch basics or llm theory or llm components basics, or math, not sur ewhat i would put here, give me suggestions
