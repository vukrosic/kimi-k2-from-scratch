Code & Train Kimi K2 From Scratch - 0 To AI Researcher Step by Step Course

0 To AI Researcher - Full Course - Code & Train Kimi K2 From Scratch

Paper name: Train LLM for $0, $1, $10



This course contains every for you to go from knowing nothing to being able to get a junior job at OpenAI or Google.

It will take you 4-12 months, depending on how much you know. This is reality. You could also go into ultra fast mode, but don't get scared, going from not knowing everything junior OpenAI employee knows and publishing your own papers in 1 year is actually very good and completely possible and this course will teach you thing.

I've given myself freedom to structure everything you need to know and enough time otherwise I can't do it in 3 days.

- Mention open superintelligence lab - if you want to do real research, join discord - 24h research

Job at OpenAI is too weak surface level motivation tht will nto sustain you, instead you can be curious about t he world and wonder how things work and why they work and do experiemnts from there.

You will not only code and train your own LM that you can talk to, but we will also write and publish a real research paper on how to create a small language model that anyone can train for free - I will publish this paper on arxiv - a real research paper that LLM that you can use to get a job at OpenAI or other frontier company, or start your own company or contribute to open source and publish more papers.

You will learn absolutely latest advancements from AI that only top researchers in the field konw, that are held behind closed dors at OpenAI and Google.

- **Beginners**: People with or without basic Python knowledge
- **Intermediate**: Developers familiar with PyTorch wanting to build LLMs
- **Advanced**: Top AI Researchers from OpenAI & Google wanting to keep up with the latest research

## **Part 1: Python Foundations**

explain how to learn python
what they should konw
give some prompts and chatbots or google colab notebooks to test them
link to resources and chats for each

#### Check timestamps / chapters below the video to skip what you know, but you can watch it even if you know it.

Learn basics of python. I recommend this video: [Python Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). No need to watch it all, but k

### Python Learning Resources
- **YouTube Tutorials (you only need to learn basics):**
You can also search for other python beginner tutorials, they will teach the same thing, you just need to learn it from one.

Examples:
  - [Python for Beginners - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) - 4.5 hours comprehensive Python tutorial
  - [Python Crash Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJmcL1N2KQs) - 1 hour quick start guide

From these tutorials you need to know:
1. How to install python on your computer
2. How to use IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write your code
3. How to execute your code with `python file_name.py`
4. Create variable, list, function, if statement, for loop.
5. Create class - this is included in the first course but you can learn more, search for object oriented programming in python.
Example: [Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/iLRZi0Gu8Go)

If you are struggling with any of these - you will be learning the most important skill - learn how to learn - how to use YouTube and AI chatbots like ChatGPT to learn.
- Search for videos and ask AI to help you with any of the issues you have - once you learn how to learn with internet and AI, you will be able to learn anything.

Example prompt for AI to teach you python 1 on 1:

"I need to master Python classes and object-oriented programming. Teach me casses step by step."

You can also run all of this on [Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A) without needing to setup local coding environment (on your computer).

## **No need to be able to code all of this from memory, but be able to read and understand what each does.**

There is a folder 01_python_beginner_lessons that will be supplementary materials for studnets to learn, it contains supplementary markdown lessons.

## **Part 2: Course Structure (Simplified)**

The course is divided into clear, progressive parts:

### 1. Neural Networks from Scratch
- Learn NumPy basics for deep learning
- Simple neuron
- Fit simple neuron
- Multiple neurons, fit a 2D curver function
- Chain rule
- Code chain rule
- Backprop and excercises
- Build and train simple neural networks (including XOR)
- Understand forward and backward pass
- Try basic optimization (SGD, Adam)

### 2. PyTorch Foundations
- Learn PyTorch tensors and autograd
- Build and train neural networks in PyTorch
- Practice with real datasets (MNIST, just mention CIFAR-10)
- Mastery of simple neural networks

### 3. LLM Theory & Components
- Understand transformer architecture and self-attention
- Build transformer blocks (encoder/decoder, normalization, feed-forward)
  - Variatiance, mean, std 
- Learn about advanced attention and MoE (Mixture of Experts)
- Explore modern LLM components (RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU)

### 4. Kimi K2 Implementation
- Study the Kimi K2 (DeepSeek V3) model structure
- Implement core components: normalization, attention, MoE, RoPE
- Assemble the full model and run inference
- Set up training and evaluation pipelines

### 5. Advanced Topics & Research
- Try advanced optimizers and training tricks
- Learn about scaling, efficiency, and quantization
- Fine-tune models and experiment with new ideas
- Write and publish your own research paper

Each part includes hands-on coding and practical exercises. Youâ€™ll build up from basics to advanced LLMs step by step.
